This project was primarily meant as a learning experience, both for me to learn C++ and to learn OpenGL.
While the end project isn't particularly impressive, it is something I'm proud of.
Note: This contains several hardcoded filepaths, so it will not work on other machines. This is quite easy to fix, however; the only filepaths that needs changing are in main.cpp and TextureLoader.cpp. To make this run on your machine, edit the file paths here to reflect where GLSL and the Sprites directories now lie.
